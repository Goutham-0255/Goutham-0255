Hey!

I’m Goutham N 😊. I’m a Computer Science student and I’ve been diving into full-stack web development 🌐. I love building things, whether it's the frontend or backend, and I’m constantly learning new skills to improve.

Right now, I’m getting into React, Node.js, and MongoDB – but I’m also messing around with UI/UX design to make sure my projects not only work but look great too 🎨. I’m all about solving problems and creating smooth, user-friendly experiences.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me reading up on the latest tech trends or just experimenting with ideas for my next project 📚🚀.

Feel free to reach out – I’m always open to chatting or collaborating! 👋
