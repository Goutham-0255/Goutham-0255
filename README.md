Hey there!👋

I’m Goutham N 😊, a Computer Science student who's passionate about full-stack web development 🌐. I’m constantly learning and building things, whether it's working on the frontend, backend, or both! I love the process of turning ideas into real, functional apps. 💻✨

At the moment, I’m diving deep into React, Node.js, and MongoDB to level up my skills. 🔧 But I’m also exploring UI/UX design because I believe great design makes a huge difference in how people experience an app 🎨. My goal is to build not just functional but also user-friendly applications that people enjoy using.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually reading tech blogs 📚, exploring new frameworks and tools, or trying out new projects to push my limits 🚀. I’m always up for learning new things and collaborating on cool projects!

Let’s connect and build something awesome together! 🤝🔥
